## spricons 
### An SVG framework for designers

Spricons is a CSS/Javascript api by [Gary M Davis](https://twitter.com/gmdavisux) to use SVG icons, images and sprites with simplified markup.

At the time of this writing, it is in alpha which means it's not quite feature-complete or documented. You may use it at your own risk. You can also offer to help develop it.

The goal of this project is to make SVG graphics easier to understand, find and use for non-developers and to provide a place to distribute free and open source svg icons and graphics. I have been inspired by the work of [Dave Gandy at fontawsome.io](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/) and other open source SVG efforts.
