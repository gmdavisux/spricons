## spricons 
### An SVG framework for designers

Spricons is a CSS/Javascript api by [Gary M Davis](https://twitter.com/gmdavisux) to use SVG icons, images and sprites with simplified markup.

Check out [spricons.com](http://spricons.com/)

At the time of this writing, it is in alpha which means it's not quite feature-complete or documented. You may use it at your own risk. You can also offer to help develop it.

The goal of this project is to make SVG graphics easier to understand, find and use for non-developers and to provide a place to distribute free and open source svg icons and graphics. I have been inspired by the work of [Dave Gandy at fontawsome.io](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/) and other open source SVG efforts.

##Software Credits
Although spricons is very different from the following, development was made possible by adapting and learning from the following components:

###[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) by Dave Gandy 
Licensed Under: MIT License

Font-awesome is the icon font and CSS toolkit that inspired spricons. I adapted much of the CSS (with significant changes for svg instead of fonts) and tried to use the same icon names. My original goal was to match the functionality and ease of use of font-awesome.

###[Evil-Icons](http://evil-icons.io/) by Alexander Madyankin, Roman Shamin 
Licensed Under: MIT License

Evil-icons is SVG icons, css and javascript that inspired portions of spricons. Specifically, I adopted the use of the data-icon attribute and the insertion of svg elements using javascript.

###Others
I learned so much about SVG from [Sara Soueidan at sarasoueidan.com](https://sarasoueidan.com/) and [Chris Coyier at css-tricks.com](https://css-tricks.com/author/chriscoyier/) and gathered a lot of ideas from their writing.
